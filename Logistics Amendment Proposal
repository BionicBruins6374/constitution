Proposed Amendment 
June 10, 2022

I. PURPOSE 
The purpose of this Amendment is… 
1. Distinguish between the job of the President/Co-President and Logistics Director role to avoid confusion
2. Delegate tasks that do not pertain to any current officer or President role *but are important* tasks that the Logistics Director could take on
3. Redefining the role of the logistical manager to make the role sustainable for the years to come and create a pathway to promote club growth

II. SUMMARY 
An informal description of the changes proposed is below. These descriptions are simply summaries and should not be interpreted as the exact rules. For specific wording see Section III (Changes). 
Logistical Manager Redefinition
Adding these tasks of community building officializes the work I have done already and ensures that such events can continue this year and guaranteed for future years
Fills in undelegated tasks that do not fit the definition of President or the other officers
Toxicity is created when members don’t feel valued enough for their contributions or strengths – and creating more team bonding can highlight member’s contributions
pres/co-pres focus more on delegating officer roles and lessen load of brainstorming team bonding 
Creating a Cross-Organization and Logistics Committee
Members may be less inclined to join the Organization committee as of now as it doesn’t necessarily bring the same ring of ~community impact~ as Outreach and Fundraising do 
Not much that the organization committee can do other than cleaning the shed and checkout system a couple times a year as teams are supposed to be responsible for cleaning up their own materials 
Other than an inventory and cleaning up the shed, there is not much room for creativity and club growth– which should be the reasons behind creating a supporting committee under directors
Having the committee overlap works anyways as Directors of Organization because there is a lot of correlation — Logistics Manager manages when build days are and lengthens them near competition time along with making competition forms, and Organization Director makes sure people clean up build days and are important to cleaning up before and after competitions (both are centered around the same couple of events so a committee helping both is good)
The committee can help both with competition stuff (see above bullet point) and community bonding events
We want that committee to be of mostly incoming freshman/new members anyways, so it is an easy way for them to make more of an impact by being involved in making fun (community building) activities






III. CHANGES 
Original Logistics Manager Description:
Helps improve communication between Officers, Advisors, and Members
Manages Build Day calendar
Set up Documents (ex. Field Trip Forms) for events and volunteering
See below for modifications to the above description
Plan/Coordinate community building events that strengthen the club culture and increase member involvement 
Promote member inclusivity by creating the necessary forms (ex: field trip and volunteer forms) and communication methods (ex: build day communication) to encourage participation

Cross-committee between organization and logistics to ensure more teambuilding and ~organization~  at build days will delete if Directors of Organization don’t agree (so far Cindy agrees)
Original Director of Organization description:
• Makes sure the club is neat and tidy
• Organizes before and after competitions
• Manages the Club’s materials such as checking out materials
• Leads the Organization Committee
Co-directs the organization committee to become a cross- organization/logistics committee to help execute said community building activities on a more regular basis


Original Logistics Description: Helps improve communication between Officers, Advisors, and Members
Original President Description: Ensures smooth interactions with Advisors and administration

Reason for Modification:
Change the President role to focus on facilitating communication between officers thru officer meetings, relaying back advisor's advice, and serving as a support system 
Emphasizing President’s role transparency about officer’s work besides making check-ups and creating cross-officer collaboration when appropriate 
Confused on “improving communication between Officers” as that feels like more of a President’s role – moreso, it’s weird to ensure that next year’s logistics officer has the expertise of improving communication between officers


Revised Logistics Description (prone to change): 
Coordinates with Advisors for build days and team building events (ex: notifying them about End-of-year party, build days, scrimmages)
Revised President Description(prone to change): 
Supervise build days, unless you can’t make it, then allocate to other officers
Prone to change if we just want to make supervision a President or a Director of Organization role by default & officers serve as substitute
Create strong communication between officers and creates transparency about officers’ work and ideas during officer and club meetings 
Ex: I'm often unsure about how much money we have/POs placed/etc. rn, and it's not necessarily the treasurer responsibility to communicate their role to others (although, a really proactive treasurer should do that)
Lead and set agendas for officer and club meetings
Ensures  smooth interactions with Advisors and administration (ex: club meetings, taking advisor’s advice or suggestions, coordinating anything that  is not a build day or team building event)
Set a vision/goals to improve the club 
Ex: suggesting events to officers such as Halloween grams, or suggesting outreach team activities to create club growth (stuff that Anvit has already demonstrated lol)
Assist and check in with each officer for accountability/support system/backup if the help is needed
Ensure thorough training for each officer to create steady strong leadership regardless of officers’ prior experience 
ex: members shadow current officers before officer selection, build on officer handbook to make sure officers feel knowledgeable about what they are doing



THE REST IS NOT A PART OF THE ACTUAL CONSTITUTION EDITS, just frequently asked question/clarification/and possible ideas of community building if the amendment is approved
Objections
Although we acknowledge and appreciate the extra things you did as co-pres to fill in for the inactivity of other officers, the logistics manager role was created with you in mind. Since we are both new presidents and this is your fourth year in the club as well as third year as officer, we wanted to make a specific role for you to utilize your talents and show your dedication to robotics. But, ultimately we don’t know if we want to keep the logistics manager role in the future and we will revisit this topic at the end of the year.
- Making the logistical manager role that fits me doesn’t contrast with making sustainable change that both helps the club
- this proposal can make the role very important and purposeful. 
Won’t coordinating team bonding events take away from the president/co-pres job?
- well, the President/Co-President role has been historically a major workload and checking in with officers, leading club meetings, setting the vision for the club is already a major task 
- Team bonding isn’t currently the task of any officer or president
- delegating team bonding to avoid possible burnout while allowing more member input
- Team bonding events is also not specified as a role of any of the current officers, but by making it an official role we can ensure good club culture
What if other officers are interested in making team bonding events?
- Like any other officer role, officers can occasionally contribute if they/ committee members can’t do it (ex: when a non-fundraising person made 3D printed hearts for V-Day, I took photos for events as a non-secretary)
- Beyond just creating a committee, creating community building events can help retain members 
Ideas/Brainstorming if we approve the amendment
Community building event ideas that we can execute through the cross-organization/logistics committee
What makes me qualified to do the additional task
teacher appreciation posters or projects
Alumni panel (aka hitting up past robotics members and asking them about their stuff)
scheduling scrimmages with advisors & then giving scrimmage prizes to celebrate member’s work
birthday giveaways/shoutouts
gift exchanges during the holiday season
creating a robotics playlist that we can play at build days, end of year parties, hackathon? Etc.
Setting up icebreaker activities to create bonds between teams
inputting quality memes in presentations
end of year party
Fun robotics trivia(?) at educational days or at club meetings when there is nothing much to talk about
snacks for long build days (cough cough the ones that may go til 5pm)

Qualifications
Already managed forms for outreach  and fundraising event participation (ex: Valentine’s grams, STEAM outreach) and created group chats/field trip forms/drivers info for competitions last year
Have a light schedule next year w/ just 6 classes and have the capacity to do so much more than setting up build days
Was an officer for 2 years – so as my 3rd year I know the ways around to make the said events happen
Brought back many things that have terminated during lockdown  & dedicated lots of sleepless nights to make this club survive through and out of the COVID lockdown
During the past two years – have taken on this role unofficially anyways by organizing teambonding games and use club meetings to take the time to appreciate members and end of year party during the shutdown 
Make great puns
Made teacher appreciation poster last year and set up the spreadsheet planning of the end of year  party this year, so it fits
Am an accountable person and managed build days/club meeting notifications for years
I have a strong work ethic and set up a lot of things that are integral to the robotics structure today (ex: helping changing the logo during the pandemic, setting up a social media presence, creating a build day structure so the room is left clean even if the org officer is absent, club meeting note template, redefining the role of Outreach team to not just be making competition bots and not competing) so I can definitely also set up a lot of fun and sustainable events 

Akilan Suggestions:
ill give you my honest opinion:
- on the one hand, I really want to officialize the work you do and have been doing. The clarification on sorts of communication and events will certainly be beneficial. On a personal level I also want to support you somehow. 
- on the other hand, I think the number of officers in the club are too many starting with Director of Organization. Organization is an extremely light role yet *two* people are assigned to it. I think the organization and logistics role (that you have outlined here) are similar enough to merge into one position that maybe needs two people. Organization role is only "busy" at like 2-3 times of year.
what I suggest:
- what if we merged Organization and Logistics into "Org and Logistics?" Then there's one director of org and another director of logistics. there are currently two directors of organization (bruh) so im not rlly sure how this is going to pan out (this would probably require "firing" someone?? which is extremely weird and would probably require an impeachment or an odd amendment) or at least putting this into a Org+Logistics committe with 3 directors for this year and 2 directors for years after that
